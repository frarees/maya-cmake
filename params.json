{"name":"maya-cmake","body":"## Installation\r\n\r\nInclude FindMaya.cmake in your user-created CMake module path. If you don't have one, you should. Follow these steps: \r\n\r\n1. Create a `cmake` (or whatever name you like) folder at the same level as your `CMakeLists.txt`. \r\n2. Open your `CMakeLists.txt` and add a reference to that path (i.e. `SET(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake)`). \r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n`find_package (Maya)` will do. \r\n\r\n## Current state\r\n\r\nThis module currently works only for a Maya 2012 distribution and should work in Windows, OS X and other UNIX platforms out of the box. It needs to be extensively expanded. See *collaboration*. \r\n\r\n## Collaboration\r\n\r\nCollaboration is encouraged thought forks and pull requests.
